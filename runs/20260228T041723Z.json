Then, `git push` to deploy.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor details on how to use Vercel, check out our [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to install dependencies and run scripts.\n\nYou can use the `vercel` script to run local changes as if you were invoking Vercel CLI. For example, `vercel deploy --cwd=/path/to/project` could be run with local changes with `pnpm vercel deploy --cwd=/path/to/project`.\n\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [Vercel Community](https://community.vercel.com/tags/c/community/4/cli) with the owners of this repository before submitting a Pull Request.\n\nPlease read our [Code of Conduct](./.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\n### Local development\n\nThis project is configured in a monorepo, where one repository contains multiple npm packages. Dependencies are installed and managed with `pnpm`, not `npm` CLI.\n\nTo get started, execute the following:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/vercel/vercel\ncd vercel\ncorepack enable\npnpm install\npnpm build\npnpm lint\npnpm test-unit\n```\n\nMake sure all the tests pass before making changes.\n\n#### Running Vercel CLI Changes\n\nYou can use `pnpm vercel` from the `cli` package to invoke Vercel CLI with local changes:\n\n```bash\ncd ./packages/cli\npnpm vercel <cli-commands...>\n```\n\nSee [CLI Local Development](../packages/cli#local-development) for more details.\n\n### Verifying your change\n\nOnce you are done with your changes (we even suggest doing it along the way), make sure all the tests still pass by running:\n\n```bash\npnpm test-unit\n```\n\nfrom the root of the project.\n\nIf any test fails, make sure to fix it along with your changes. See [Interpreting test errors](#Interpreting-test-errors) for more information about how the tests are executed, especially the integration tests.\n\n### Pull Request Process\n\nOnce you are confident that your changes work properly, open a pull request on the main repository.\n\nThe pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers and the tests will be checked by our continuous integration platform.\n\n### Interpreting test errors\n\nThere are 2 kinds of tests in this repository – Unit tests and Integration tests.\n\nUnit tests are run locally with `jest` and execute quickly because they are testing the smallest units of code.\n\n#### Integration tests\n\nIntegration tests create deployments to your Vercel account using the `test` project name. After each test is deployed, the `probes` key is used to check if the response is the expected value. If the value doesn't match, you'll see a message explaining the difference. If the deployment failed to build, you'll see a more generic message like the following:\n\n```log\n[Error: Fetched page https://test-8ashcdlew.vercel.app/root.js does not contain hello Root!. Instead it contains An error occurred with this application.\n\n    NO_STATUS_CODE_FRO Response headers:\n       cache-control=s-maxage=0\n      connection=close\n      content-type=text/plain; charset=utf-8\n      date=Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:01:37 GMT\n      server=now\n      strict-transport-security=max-age=63072000\n      transfer-encoding=chunked\n      x-now-id=iad1:hgtzj-1560967297876-44ae12559f95\n      x-now-trace=iad1]\n```\n\nIn such cases, you can visit the URL of the failed deployment and append `/_logs` to see the build error. In the case above, that would be https://test-8ashcdlew.vercel.app/_logs\n\nThe logs of this deployment will contain the actual error which may help you to understand what went wrong.\n\n##### Running integration tests locally\n\nWhile running the full integration suite locally is not recommended, it's sometimes useful to isolate a failing test by running it on your machine. To do so, you'll need to ensure you have the appropriate credentials sourced in your shell:\n\n1. Create an access token. Follow the instructions here https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token. Ensure the token scope is for your personal\n   account.\n2. Grab the team ID from the Vercel dashboard at `https://vercel.com/<MY-TEAM>/~/settings`.\n3. Source these into your shell rc file: `echo 'export VERCEL_TOKEN=<MY-TOKEN> VERCEL_TEAM_ID=<MY-TEAM-ID>' >> ~/.zshrc`\n\nFrom there, you should be able to trigger an integration test. Choose one\nthat's already isolated to check that things work:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/next\n```\n\nRun the test:\n\n```bash\npnpm test test/fixtures/00-server-build/index.test.js\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you receive a `401` status code while fetching the deployment, you need to disable [Deployment Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection) on the project.\n\n#### @vercel/nft\n\nSome of the Builders use `@vercel/nft` to tree-shake files before deployment. If you suspect an error with this tree-shaking mechanism, you can create the following script in your project:\n\n```js\nconst { nodeFileTrace } = require('@vercel/nft');\nnodeFileTrace(['path/to/entrypoint.js'], {\n  ts: true,\n  mixedModules: true,\n})\n  .then(o => console.log(o.fileList))\n  .then(e => console.error(e));\n```\n\nWhen you run this script, you'll see all the imported files. If files are missing, the bug is in [@vercel/nft](https://github.com/vercel/nft) and not the Builder.\n\n### Deploy a Builder with existing project\n\nSometimes you want to test changes to a Builder against an existing project, maybe with `vercel dev` or actual deployment. You can avoid publishing every Builder change to npm by uploading the Builder as a tarball.\n\n1. Change directory to the desired Builder `cd ./packages/node`\n2. Run `pnpm build` to compile typescript and other build steps\n3. Run `npm pack` to create a tarball file. It is imporant to not use `pnpm pack` because it will not preserve the file permissions\n4. Move the resulting tarball to a directory\n5. Run `vercel <directory>` to upload the tarball file and get a URL. Remember to append `/<tarball name>` to then end of your URL\n6. Edit any existing `vercel.json` project and replace `use` with the URL\n7. Run `vercel` or `vercel dev` to deploy with the experimental Builder\n\n**Note:** You will need to turn off vercel authentication in settings -> deployment protection so the builder can be downloaded\n\n## Reference\n\n- [Code of Conduct](./.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n- [Contributing Guidelines](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE)\n",

All context.\n\n</div>\n\n![ultracontext-gif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be73afe5-161d-4fa3-8f4d-c4987fe63cb4)\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nAgents now do our work. Today, most of our knowledge and key decisions live inside context windows. But they are spread across many agents, computers, and teams.\n\nNot anymore.\n\n## UltraContext Features\n\n- **Auto-ingest** — Captures contexts from your agents in realtime.\n- **Realtime access** — Immediately see contexts created on any machine, by any agent, whenever you want.\n- **Collaborate** — Share contexts across your team. See what everyone sees, instantly and without any friction.\n- **Switch between agents** — Pick up where one agent left off with another.\n- **Open source** — Own your data. Self-host when you need to.\n- **Plug and play** — Install and run with a single line of code.\n- **Fork & clone** — Continue contexts while preserving the full history.\n- **Customizable** — Add your own agents and extend behavior with the context API ([Docs here](https://ultracontext.ai/docs/api-reference/introduction)).\n\n## Install\n\nRequires **Node >= 22**.\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g ultracontext\n```\n\nThat's it. The setup wizard runs automatically — walks you through API key, sync preferences, and launches the dashboard.\n\nAlready installed? Run `ultracontext config` to reconfigure.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\nultracontext              # start daemon + open dashboard\nultracontext config       # run setup wizard\nultracontext start        # start daemon only\nultracontext stop         # stop daemon\nultracontext status       # check if daemon is running\nultracontext tui          # open dashboard only\n```\n\nThe default ultracontext command does everything: checks the daemon, starts it if needed, and opens the TUI dashboard.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. A daemon runs in the background, watching your agents.\n2. Contexts are ingested in realtime with the Context API.\n3. Your Context Hub gets updated.\n\nWe use a git-like context engineering API under the hood to interact with the agent's contexts. You can use it to add your own custom agents, tweak behavior and more. ([Docs here](https://ultracontext.ai/docs/))\n\nWhen you open an existing session from the hub, it forks the context, so the original context is always preserved by default and automatically versioned so you can keep track of it later using metadata.\n\nThere is a local caching layer that prevents duplicate context creations and appends.\n\n## Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=ultracontext/ultracontext&type=date&legend=top-left)](https://www.star-history.com/#ultracontext/ultracontext&type=date&legend=top-left)\n\n\n## Everything we built so far\n\n- Daemon - Runs in the background, watching your agents.\n- TUI - Terminal UI for the daemon.\n- [Context API](https://ultracontext.ai/docs/) - Git-like context engineering API.\n- [Context API SDKs](https://ultracontext.ai/docs/quickstart/nodejs) - Node and Python SDKs.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n# The Context API\n\n</div>\n\nThe Context API is the simplest way to control what your agents see. Replace messages, compact/offload long context, replay decisions and roll back mistakes with a single API call. Versioned context out of the box. Full history. Zero complexity. You can use the API standalone to build your own agents or to tweak behavior of existing ones in ultracontext. ([Docs here](https://ultracontext.ai/docs/api-reference/introduction))\n\n## Context API SDKs\n\n| SDK | Install | Source |\n|-----|---------|--------|\n| JavaScript/TypeScript | `npm install ultracontext` | [apps/js-sdk](./apps/js-sdk) |\n| Python | `pip install ultracontext` | [apps/python-sdk](./apps/python-sdk) |\n\n\n### JavaScript/TypeScript\n\n```bash\nnpm install ultracontext\n```\n\n```js\nimport { UltraContext } from 'ultracontext';\n\nconst uc = new UltraContext({ apiKey: 'uc_live_...' });\n\nconst ctx = await uc.create();\nawait uc.append(ctx.id, { role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' });\n\n// use with any LLM framework\nconst response = await generateText({ model, messages: ctx.data });\n```\n\n### Python\n\n```bash\npip install ultracontext\n```\n\n```python\nfrom ultracontext import UltraContext\n\nuc = UltraContext(api_key=\"uc_live_...\")\n\nctx = uc.create()\nuc.append(ctx[\"id\"], {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"})\n\n# use with any LLM framework\nresponse = generate_text(model=model, messages=uc.get(ctx[\"id\"])[\"data\"])\n```\n\nGet an API key from the [UltraContext Dashboard](https://ultracontext.ai/dashboard).\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Quickstart](https://ultracontext.ai/docs/quickstart/nodejs) — Get running in 2 minutes\n- [Guides](https://ultracontext.ai/docs/guides/store-retrieve-contexts) — Practical patterns for common use cases\n- [API Reference](https://ultracontext.ai/docs/api-reference/introduction) — Full endpoint documentation\n\n---\n",

In the [~500px² responsive browser section](https://tamagui.dev) of the Tamagui website, 49 of the 55 or so [inline styled components](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/main/code/tamagui.dev/components/HeroResponsive.tsx) are flattened to a `div`. The homepage gains nearly 15% on Lighthouse with the compiler on.\n\n[Learn more on the website](https://tamagui.dev/docs/intro/introduction).\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to Tamagui reference the [contributing guide](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute to documentation reference the [writing guide](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/main/code/tamagui.dev/WRITING-GUIDE.md).\n",

If you have an older version of fzf, or want finer control, you can\n> source individual script files in the [/shell](/shell) directory. The\n> location of the files may vary depending on the package manager you use.\n> Please refer to the package documentation for more information.\n> (e.g. `apt show fzf`)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can disable CTRL-T, CTRL-R, or ALT-C bindings by setting the\n> corresponding `*_COMMAND` variable to an empty string when sourcing the\n> script. For example, to disable CTRL-R and ALT-C:\n>\n> * bash: `FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= eval \"$(fzf --bash)\"`\n> * zsh: `FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source <(fzf --zsh)`\n> * fish: `fzf --fish | FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source`\n>\n> Setting the variables after sourcing the script will have no effect.\n\n### Vim/Neovim plugin\n\nIf you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add this to\nyour Vim configuration file:\n\n```vim\nPlug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }\nPlug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'\n```\n\n* `junegunn/fzf` provides the basic library functions\n    * `fzf#install()` makes sure that you have the latest binary\n* `junegunn/fzf.vim` is [a separate project](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)\n  that provides a variety of useful commands\n\nTo learn more about the Vim integration, see [README-VIM.md](README-VIM.md).\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If you use Neovim and prefer Lua-based plugins, check out\n> [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua).\n\nUpgrading fzf\n-------------\n\nfzf is being actively developed, and you might want to upgrade it once in a\nwhile. Please follow the instruction below depending on the installation\nmethod used.\n\n- git: `cd ~/.fzf && git pull && ./install`\n- brew: `brew update; brew upgrade fzf`\n- macports: `sudo port upgrade fzf`\n- chocolatey: `choco upgrade fzf`\n- vim-plug: `:PlugUpdate fzf`\n\nBuilding fzf\n------------\n\nSee [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nfzf will launch interactive finder, read the list from STDIN, and write the\nselected item to STDOUT.\n\n```sh\nfind * -type f | fzf > selected\n```\n\nWithout STDIN pipe, fzf will traverse the file system under the current\ndirectory to get the list of files.\n\n```sh\nvim $(fzf)\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> You can override the default behavior\n> * Either by setting `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` to a command that generates the desired list\n> * Or by setting `--walker`, `--walker-root`, and `--walker-skip` options in `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> A more robust solution would be to use `xargs` but we've presented\n> the above as it's easier to grasp\n> ```sh\n> fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim\n> ```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> fzf also has the ability to turn itself into a different process.\n>\n> ```sh\n> fzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {})'\n> ```\n>\n> *See [Turning into a different process](#turning-into-a-different-process)\n> for more information.*\n\n### Using the finder\n\n- `CTRL-K` / `CTRL-J` (or `CTRL-P` / `CTRL-N`) to move cursor up and down\n- `Enter` key to select the item, `CTRL-C` / `CTRL-G` / `ESC` to exit\n- On multi-select mode (`-m`), `TAB` and `Shift-TAB` to mark multiple items\n- Emacs style key bindings\n- Mouse: scroll, click, double-click; shift-click and shift-scroll on\n  multi-select mode\n\n### Display modes\n\nfzf by default runs in fullscreen mode, but there are other display modes.\n\n#### `--height` mode\n\nWith `--height HEIGHT[%]`, fzf will start below the cursor with the given height.\n\n```sh\nfzf --height 40%\n```\n\n`reverse` layout and `--border` goes well with this option.\n\n```sh\nfzf --height 40% --layout reverse --border\n```\n\nBy prepending `~` to the height, you're setting the maximum heigh",
