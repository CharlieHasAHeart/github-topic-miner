        "text": "# Mullvad VPN desktop and mobile app\n\nWelcome to the Mullvad VPN client app source code repository.\nThis is the VPN client software for the Mullvad VPN service.\nFor more information about the service, please visit our website,\n[mullvad.net](https://mullvad.net) (Also accessible via Tor on our\n[onion service](http://o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion/)).\n\nThis repository contains all the source code for the\ndesktop and mobile versions of the app. For desktop this includes the system service/daemon\n([`mullvad-daemon`](mullvad-daemon/)), a graphical user interface ([GUI](desktop/)) and a command\nline interface ([CLI](mullvad-cli/)). The Android app uses the same backing system service for the\ntunnel and security but has a dedicated frontend in [android/](android/). iOS consists of a\ncompletely standalone implementation that resides in [ios/](ios/).\n\n## Releases\n\nThere are built and signed releases for macOS, Windows, Linux and Android available on\n[our website](https://mullvad.net/download/) and on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/releases/). The Android app is also available\non [Google Play] and [F-Droid] and the iOS version on [App Store].\n\n[Google Play]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mullvad.mullvadvpn\n[F-Droid]: https://f-droid.org/packages/net.mullvad.mullvadvpn/\n[App Store]: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mullvad-vpn/id1488466513\n\nYou can find our code signing keys as well as instructions for how to cryptographically verify\nyour download on [Mullvad's Open Source page].\n\n### Platform/OS support\n\nThese are the operating systems and their versions that the app officially supports. It might\nwork on many more versions, but we don't test for those and can't guarantee the quality or\nsecurity.\n\n| OS/Platform | Supported versions |\n|-------------|--------------------|\n| Windows     | 10 and 11          |\n| macOS       | The three latest major releases |\n| Linux (Ubuntu)| The two latest LTS releases and the latest non-LTS releases |\n| Linux (Fedora) | The versions that are not yet [EOL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life) |\n| Linux (Debian) | 12 and newer    |\n| Android     | 8 and newer        |\n| iOS         | 17.0 and newer     |\n\nOn Linux we test using the Gnome desktop environment. The app should, and probably does work\nin other DEs, but we don't regularly test those.\n\n## Features\n\nHere is a table containing the features of the app across platforms. This is intended to reflect\nthe current state of the latest code in git, not necessarily any existing release.\n\n|                                         | Windows | Linux | macOS | Android | iOS |\n|-----------------------------------------|:-------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|:---:|\n| WireGuard                               |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| Quantum-resistant tunnels               |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| [DAITA]                                 |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| WireGuard multihop                      |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| WireGuard over TCP                      |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| WireGuard over Shadowsocks              |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| WireGuard over QUIC                     |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| Lightweight WireGuard Obfuscation (LWO) |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |     |\n| Split tunneling                         |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |     |\n| Custom DNS server                       |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| Content blockers (Ads etc)              |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| Optional local network access           |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓\\* |\n| [Externally audited](./audits)          |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓ |\n\n\\* The local network is always accessible on iOS with the current implementation\n\n[DAITA]: https://mullvad.net/en/blog/introducing-defense-against-ai-guided-traffic-analysis-daita\n\n## User security, privacy and anonymity\n\nThis app is a privacy preserving VPN client. As such it goes to great lengths to stop traffic\nleaks. And basically all settings default to the more secure/private option. The user has to\nexplicitly allow more loose rules if desired. See the [dedicated security document] for details\non what the app blocks and allows, as well as how it does it.\n\n[dedicated security document]: docs/security.md\n\n## Secure development\n\nSince the security of the users of the app is a top priority, by extension the security\nof the development and release process also becomes a top priority. This is something we work\nactively on.\n\n[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/9411/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/9411)\n\n### Git signatures\n\nAll merge commits to the main branch must be PGP (gpg) signed in git. This signs off the entire\nfeature branch. The individual commits in the feature branch do not need to be signed,\nunless they change one or more of the files deemed extra important.\n\nThe list of files requiring signatures to every commit that change them is defined in the\n[`verify-locked-down-signatures`](.github/workflows/verify-locked-down-signatures.yml)\nworkflow.\n\n### Audits, pentests and external security reviews\n\nThis app is audited by external security experts and penetration testers every second year.\nWe also carry out feature specific audits for certain security critical features and changes.\n\nThe results of these audits are always made public in their unredacted original form, for\nfull transparency towards the users. See the [audits readme](./audits/README.md) for this.\n\nMoreover, we welcome any individual to review the security of this app and submit any found\nissue to us. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for more.\n\n## Checking out the code\n\nThis repository contains submodules needed for building the app. However, some of those submodules\nalso have further submodules that are quite large and not needed to build the app. So unless\nyou want the source code for all submodules you should avoid a recursive clone of the repository.\nInstead clone the repository normally and then get one level of submodules:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app.git\ncd mullvadvpn-app\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\nOn Android, Windows, Linux and macOS you also want to checkout the wireguard-go submodule:\n```bash\ngit submodule update --init wireguard-go-rs/libwg/wireguard-go\n```\nFurther details on why this is necessary can be found in the [wireguard-go-rs crate](./wireguard-go-rs/README.md).\n\nWe sign every merge commit to the `main` branch as well as our release tags.\nIf you would like to verify your checkout, you can find our developer keys on\n[Mullvad's Open Source page].\n\n### Binaries submodule\n\nThis repository has a git submodule at `dist-assets/binaries`. This submodule contains binaries and\nbuild scripts for third party code we need to bundle with the app, such as Wintun.\n\nThis submodule conforms to the same integrity/security standards as this repository. Every merge\ncommit should be signed. And this main repository should only ever point to a signed merge commit\nof the binaries submodule.\n\nSee the [binaries submodule's](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app-binaries) README for more\ndetails about that repository.\n\n## Building the app\n\nSee the [build instructions](BuildInstructions.md) for help building the app on desktop platforms.\n\nFor building the Android app, see the [instructions](./android/docs/BuildInstructions.md) for Android.\n\nFor building the iOS app, see the [instructions](./ios/BuildInstructions.md) for iOS.\n\n## Releasing the app\n\nSee [this](Release.md) for instructions on how to make a new release.\n\n## Environment variables used by the service\n\n* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DEBUG` - Helps debugging the firewall. Does different things depending on\n  platform:\n  * Linux: Set to `\"1\"` to add packet counters to all firewall rules.\n  * macOS: Makes rules log the packets they match to the `pflog0` interface.\n    * Set to `\"all\"` to add logging to all rules.\n    * Set to `\"pass\"` to add logging to rules allowing packets.\n    * Set to `\"drop\"` to add logging to rules blocking packets.\n\n* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DONT_SET_SRC_VALID_MARK` - Set this variable to `1` to stop the daemon from\n    setting the `net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark` kernel parameter to `1` on Linux when a tunnel\n    is established.\n    The kernel config parameter is set by default, because otherwise strict reverse path filtering\n    may prevent relay traffic from reaching the daemon. If `rp_filter` is set to `1` on the interface\n    that will be receiving relay traffic, and `src_valid_mark` is not set to `1`, the daemon will\n    not be able to receive relay traffic.\n\n* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DONT_SET_ARP_IGNORE` - Set this variable to `1` to stop the daemon from\n    setting the `net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore` kernel parameter to `2` on Linux when a tunnel\n    is established.\n    The kernel config parameter is set by default, because otherwise an attacker who can send ARP\n    requests to the device running Mullvad can figure out the in-tunnel IP.\n\n* `TALPID_DNS_MODULE` - Allows changing the method that will be used for DNS configuration.\n  By default this is automatically detected, but you can set it to one of the options below to\n  choose a specific method.\n\n  * Linux\n    * `\"static-file\"`: change the `/etc/resolv.conf` file directly\n    * `\"resolvconf\"`: use the `resolvconf` program\n    * `\"systemd\"`: use systemd's `resolved` service through DBus\n    * `\"network-manager\"`: use `NetworkManager` service through DBus\n\n  * Windows\n    * `iphlpapi`: use the IP helper API\n    * `netsh`: use the `netsh` program\n    * `tcpip`: set TCP/IP parameters in the registry\n\n* `TALPID_DISABLE_LOCAL_DNS_RESOLVER` - Set this variable to `1` to disable the local DNS resolver\n  (macOS only).\n\n* `TALPID_NEVER_FILTER_AAAA_QUERIES` - Set this variable to `1` to never ignore DNS AAAA queries\n  (macOS only).\n\n* `TALPID_FORCE_USERSPACE_WIREGUARD` - Forces the daemon to use the userspace implementation of\n   WireGuard.\n\n* `TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR` - Forces the daemon to always assume the host is online.\n\n* `TALPID_CGROUP2_FS` - On Linux, forces the daemon to look for the cgroup2 filesystem at the\n  specified path, instead of `/sys/fs/cgroup`. The cgroup2 used for split tunneling will be created\n  in this directory.\n\n* `TALPID_NET_CLS_MOUNT_DIR` - On Linux, forces the daemon to mount the `net_cls` controller in the\n  specified directory if it isn't mounted already. This will only have an effect on older systems\n  where cgroup v1 is used for split tunneling.\n\n* `MULLVAD_MANAGEMENT_SOCKET_GROUP` - On Linux and macOS, this restricts access to the management\n  interface UDS socket to users in the specified group. This means that only users in that group can\n  use the CLI and GUI. By default, everyone has access to the socket.\n\n* `MULLVAD_BACKTRACE_ON_FAULT` - When enabled, if the daemon encounters a fault (e.g. `SIGSEGV`),\n  it will log a backtrace to stdout, and to `daemon.log`. By default, this is disabled in\n  release-builds and enabled in debug-builds. Set variable to `1` or `0` to explicitly enable or\n  disable this feature. Logging the backtrace causes heap allocation. Allocation is not signal safe,\n  but here it runs in the signal handler. This is technically undefined behavior and therefore\n  disabled by default. This usually works, but enable at your own risk.\n\n### Development builds only\n\n* `MULLVAD_API_HOST` - Set the hostname to use in API requests. E.g. `api.mullvad.net`.\n\n* `MULLVAD_API_ADDR` - Set the IP address and port to use in API requests. E.g. `10.10.1.2:443`.\n\n* `MULLVAD_API_DISABLE_TLS` - Use plain HTTP for API requests.\n\n* `MULLVAD_CONNCHECK_HOST` - Set the hostname to use in connection check requests. E.g. `am.i.mullvad.net`.\n\n* `MULLVAD_ENABLE_DEV_UPDATES` - Enable version checks in",

Expect rough edges, breaking changes, and missing features. Contributions and bug reports are very welcome!\n\n> **Fork notice:** Neomacs is a hard fork of GNU Emacs, forked from commit [`705c0e3729`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=705c0e3729bf53db9e84ae7c8b932ebc3b2da934). The changes are too invasive to ever be accepted upstream, so we did not preserve the original git history to keep the repository lightweight. If you need the full Emacs git history for reference, open an issue, and we can re-add it.\n\n> **Why a fork, not from scratch?** Neomacs aims for 100% compatibility with official GNU Emacs — every config, package, and workflow should just work. By forking, we keep the original Emacs C code as a reference and test oracle: we can verifying that each Rust rewrite produces identical behavior, ensuring nothing breaks as subsystems are replaced one by one.\n\n---\n\n## The Problem\n\nEmacs is a 40-year-old C codebase that hasn't kept up with modern hardware or software engineering:\n\n- **Display engine** — ~50,000 lines of C in `xdisp.c`, designed for text terminals in the 1980s. CPU-only rendering, no GPU acceleration, no native video/animations, no smooth visual effects\n  - **Large images** — rendering slows down significantly\n  - **Video playback** — not natively supported\n  - **Modern animations** — no smooth cursor movement, buffer transitions, or visual effects\n  - **Web content** — limited browser integration\n  - **GPU utilization** — everything runs on CPU while your GPU sits idle\n- **Elisp performance** — no inline caching, stop-the-world GC, dynamic dispatch overhead. Even with native-comp (AOT), Elisp lacks runtime JIT optimization, speculative inlining, and concurrent GC — leaving significant performance on the table\n- **Unsafe C codebase** — ~300,000 lines of unsafe C with manual memory management, monolithic architecture (runtime and editor entangled), single-threaded design that prevents real concurrency\n\n## The Solution\n\nThrow it all away and start fresh.\n\n**Neomacs** is rewriting Emacs from the ground up in **Rust** — starting with the display engine and expanding to the core:\n\n- **GPU display engine** *(done)* — ~4,000 lines of Rust replacing ~50,000 lines of legacy C, powered by wgpu (Vulkan/Metal/DX12/OpenGL)\n- **Rust layout engine** *(done)* — bypasses `xdisp.c` entirely, reads buffer text via FFI and computes layout in Rust\n- **Inline video/images/WebKit** *(done)* — 4K video, GPU-decoded images, and WPE WebKit browser views embedded directly in buffers\n- **21 scroll effects, 8 cursor modes, 10 buffer transitions** *(done)* — GPU-accelerated animations running on the render thread at display refresh rate\n- **Zero-copy DMA-BUF** *(done)* — efficient GPU texture sharing (Linux)\n- **Rewrite entire Emacs core in Rust** *(in progress)* — replacing all ~300,000 lines of C with safe, modern Rust: Elisp runtime, evaluator, bytecode VM, GC, buffer/window/frame subsystems, and all editor internals\n- **True multi-threaded Elisp** *(planned)* — real concurrency for the Lisp machine, not just cooperative threading\n- **10x performance, and 100% Emacs compatibility.** *(planned)* — Rust-optimized Lisp machine with JIT compilation and inline caching\n\n---\n\n## Showcase\n\n### Animations (Cursor, Buffer Switch, Scroll)\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85b7ee7b-3f4a-4cd2-a84f-86a91d052f11\n\n### GPU Text with Rounded Box Faces\n\n<img width=\"1868\" alt=\"Round corner box face attribute\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65db32f0-8852-4091-bd99-d61f839e0c95\" />\n\n### Inline 4K Images\n\nGPU-decoded directly — no CPU cost, won't block Emacs main thread.\n\n<img width=\"1447\" alt=\"Inline 4K images in Emacs buffer\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/325719dc-dac4-4bd8-8fd9-e638450a489f\" />\n\n### Inline Web Browser (WPE WebKit)\n\nGPU backend, DMA-BUF zero-copy.\n\n<img width=\"1851\" alt=\"Inline WPE WebKit browser in Emacs buffer\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10e833ca-34b2-4200-b368-09f7510f50d0\" />\n\n### Inline Terminal (Alacritty)\n\nGPU-backed terminal emulator embedded in Emacs buffer.\n\n<img width=\"1448\" alt=\"Inline Alacritty terminal in Emacs buffer\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/175ffd75-78b5-46c9-9562-61cfd705e358\" />\n\n### Inline 4K Video Playback\n\nDMA-BUF zero-copy, GPU backend — no CPU cost.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/275c6d9a-fced-44f6-8f43-3bbd2984d672\n\n---\n\n## Features\n\n### Working Now\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **GPU Text Rendering** | Hardware-accelerated text via wgpu (Vulkan/Metal/DX12/OpenGL) |\n| **Video Playback** | GStreamer + VA-API hardware decode with DMA-BUF zero-copy |\n| **Cursor Animations** | 8 modes with 7 movement styles and configurable spring trail |\n| **Scroll Animations** | 21 scroll effects with 5 easing functions |\n| **Buffer Transitions** | 10 buffer-switch effects (crossfade, slide, page-curl, etc.) |\n| **DMA-BUF Zero-Copy** | GPU-to-GPU texture sharing via Vulkan HAL (no CPU readback) |\n| **Inline Images** | GPU-accelerated image rendering in buffers |\n| **Inline WebKit** | WPE WebKit browser views embedded in buffers |\n\n### Animations\n\nAll animations run on the GPU render thread at display refresh rate, independent of the Emacs redisplay.

The goal is a\nlayered architecture where the Elisp runtime is a self-contained core, editor subsystems\nare independent modules communicating through defined APIs, and the rendering engine runs\non a separate GPU thread.\n\n### Current State\n\nThe rendering engine and layout engine are already in Rust. The Emacs C core still runs\nthe Elisp evaluator, GC, and editor subsystems — connected to Rust via FFI channels.\n\n### Target Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                         Neomacs (Rust)                          │\n│                                                                 │\n│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │\n│  │                  Elisp Runtime Core                      │   │\n│  │  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐       │   │\n│  │  │ Evaluator   │  │ Bytecode VM │  │ GC/Allocator│       │   │\n│  │  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └───",

If you are looking for op-reth, please see the new repository.\n\n## What is Reth?\n\nReth (short for Rust Ethereum, [pronunciation](https://x.com/kelvinfichter/status/1597653609411268608)) is a new Ethereum full node implementation that is focused on being user-friendly, highly modular, as well as being fast and efficient. Reth is an Execution Layer (EL) and is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is originally built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.\n\n## Goals\n\nAs a full Ethereum node, Reth allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes sending and receiving transactions/logs/traces, as well as accessing and interacting with smart contracts. Building a successful Ethereum node requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use on consumer hardware. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.\n\nMore concretely, our goals are:\n\n1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node's crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node's database, or \"unbundling\" the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project's components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).\n2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we use Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we've battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).\n3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.\n4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there's a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum's antifragility.\n5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and more. If you're working on any of these projects, please reach out. Note: OP-Reth has moved to [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).\n6. **Configurability**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via \"fast sync\". We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable \"profiles\" for the tradeoffs that each team faces.\n\n## Status\n\nReth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.\n\nMore historical context below:\n\n- We released 1.0 \"production-ready\" stable Reth in June 2024.\n  - Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).\n  - Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://x.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)). We will publish the results soon.\n- We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3, 2024, the last beta release.\n- We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4, 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing \"history\" to be mounted on separate drives.\n- We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28, 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).\n- We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) on June 20, 2023.\n\n### Database compatibility\n\nWe do not have any breaking database changes since beta.1, and we do not plan any in the near future.\n\nReth [v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) includes\na [set of breaking database changes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5191) that makes it impossible to use database files produced by earlier versions.\n\nIf you had a database produced by alpha versions of Reth, you need to drop it with `reth db drop`\n(using the same arguments such as `--config` or `--datadir` that you passed to `reth node`), and resync using the same `reth node` command you've used before.\n\n## For Users\n\nSee the [Reth documentation](https://reth.rs/) for instructions on how to install and run Reth.\n\n## For Developers\n\n### Using reth as a library\n\nYou can use individual crates of reth in your project.\n\nThe crate docs can be found [here](https://reth.rs/docs/).\n\nFor a general overview of the crates, see [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).\n\n### Contributing\n\nIf you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/paradigm_reth) to chat with us about the development of Reth!\n\n- Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n- See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).\n\n### Building and testing\n\n<!--\nWhen updating this, also update:\n- Cargo.toml\n- .github/workflows/lint.yml\n-->\n\nThe Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.93.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2026/01/22/Rust-1.93.0/).\n\nSee the docs for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://reth.rs/installation/source/).\n\nTo fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.\n\nFirst, clone the repository:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth\ncd reth\n```\n\nNext, run the tests:\n\n```sh\ncargo nextest run --workspace\n\n# Run the Ethereum Foundation tests\nmake ef-tests\n```\n\nWe highly recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing.\nUsing `cargo test` to run tests may work fine, but this is not tested and does not support more advanced features like retries for spurious failures.\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.\n\n## Getting Help\n\nIf you have any questions, first see if the answer to your question can be found in the [docs][book].\n\nIf the answer is not there:\n\n- Join the [Telegram][tg-url] to get help, or\n- Open a [discussion](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/discussions/new) with your question, or\n- Open an issue with [the bug](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/new?assignees=&labels=C-bug%2CS-needs-triage&projects=&template=bug.yml)\n\n## Security\n\nSee [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nReth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:\n\n- [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.\n- [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the [\"Staged Sync\" architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.\n- [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula's [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80). Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.\n\n## Warning\n\nThe `NippyJar` and `Compact` encoding formats and their implementations are designed for storing and retrieving data internally. They are not hardened to safely read potentially malicious data.\n\n[book]: https://reth.rs/\n[tg-url]: https://t.me/paradigm_reth\n",

We envision that developers will import the node's crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node's database, or \"unbundling\" the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project's components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md). 2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we use Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we've battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/). 3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community.

It\ndemonstrates how to create a basic RDP client with just a few hundred lines\nof code by leveraging the IronRDP crates suite.\n\nIn this basic client implementation, the client establishes a connection\nwith the destination server, decodes incoming graphics updates, and saves the\nresulting output as a BMP image file on the disk.\n\n```shell\ncargo run --example=screenshot -- --host <HOSTNAME> --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD> --output out.bmp\n```\n\n### How to enable RemoteFX on server\n\nRun the following PowerShell commands, and reboot.\n\n```pwsh\nSet-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Terminal Services' -Name 'ColorDepth' -Type DWORD -Value 5\nSet-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Terminal Services' -Name 'fEnableVirtualizedGraphics' -Type DWORD -Value 1\n```\n\nAlternatively, you may change a few group policies using `gpedit.msc`:\n\n1. Run `gpedit.msc`.\n\n2. Enable `Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Remote Desktop Services/Remote Desktop Session Host/Remote Session Environment/RemoteFX for Windows Server 2008 R2/Configure RemoteFX`\n\n3. Enable `Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Remote Desktop Services/Remote Desktop Session Host/Remote Session Environment/Enable RemoteFX encoding for RemoteFX clients designed for Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1`\n\n4. Enable `Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Remote Desktop Services/Remote Desktop Session Host/Remote Session Environment/Limit maximum color depth`\n\n5. Reboot.\n\n## Architecture\n\nSee the [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.\n\n## Getting help\n\n- Report bugs in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/issues)\n- Discuss the project on the [matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#IronRDP:matrix.org)\n",

In `afterNavigate`, this is always the final scroll position after navigation completed.\n\n    This enables use cases like animating transitions based on the target scroll position when using browser back/forward navigation.\n\n-   feat: `hydratable`'s injected script now works with CSP ([#15048](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/15048))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n-   fix: put preloads before styles ([#15232](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/15232))\n\n\n-   fix: suppress false-positive inner content warning when children prop is forwarded to a child component ([#15269](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/15269))\n\n\n-   fix: `fetch` not working when URL is same host but different than `paths.base` ([#15291](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/15291))\n\n\n-   fix: navigate to hash link when base element is present ([#15236](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/15236))\n\n\n-   fix: avoid triggering `handleError` when redirecting in a remote function ([#15222](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/15222))\n\n\n-   fix: include `test` directory in generated `tsconfig.json` alongside existing `tests` entry ([#15254](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/15254))\n\n\n-   fix: generate `tsconfig.json` using the value of `kit.files.src` ([#15253](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/15253))\n"
